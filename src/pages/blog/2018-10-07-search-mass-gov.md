In December 2017, Mass.gov team shifted the attention to its search platform and quickly pulled together a project team aiming to release a replacement product for the GSS that will continue power the internal search for Mass.gov Drupal site before Google Site Search was schedule to retire by the end of March 2017. In 3 months, we must figure out an option to ensure the Mass.gov search was not disrupted, with goals to meet the business requirements from all stakeholders within the organization and Mass.gov customer organizations, and most importantly improve the ability of constituents to quickly and easily find the content they are looking for.
